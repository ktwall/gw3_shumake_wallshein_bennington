                <p>Everyone in Haddonfeild knows the story of the Myers’ house. On Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers murdered his sister Judith with a kitchen knife. The house was abandoned for 15 years until local real estate agent Morgan Strode tried to sell it. A vengeful Michael returned, seeking out Strode’s daughter Laurie and her friends. This would become known as The Halloween Night Massacre—4 found dead, only one survivor. The sole survivor was none other than Laurie Strode, who remains reclusive to this day….</p>

                <p>
There is much mystery surrounding that fateful night in 1978. Was Michael really back? Why did he target Laurie and her friends? And what happened of him after, when no body was recovered at the scene of the crimes? It’s unknown what came of Michael but it’s said that he returns on Halloween to haunt the streets of Haddonfield in search of new victims.
