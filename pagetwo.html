                <p>More reports have come in overnight alledging a large man walking through the streets at night. Local law enforcements are clearly trying to contain the growing buzz evident in a statement released this week by Sheriff Barker. “We will not, under any circumstances, be cancelling Halloween festivities for this year.” He continued by saying that those reports were “unconfirmed” and had not been verified by the Haddonfield PD. Despite his attitude and earlier statement, Barker ordered multiple officers to patrol the streets in preparation for tonight’s events.</p>

                <p>Two more Polaroids were discovered in the garden outside of the old Myers’ house this morning. Current owners John Soto and John Massey said they had not seen the photos before, but had been receiving pranksters and “constant harassment” over the past week.
“It seems that these photos have already begun circulating,” Massey says, “and it’s only a matter of time before the whole town is talking about the possible return of Michael Myers. That’s how these small town rumors start.” Things are expected to get particularly hectic during "Hell night" tonight as many teens will be gatheting solely to cause trouble. Although, they should be extra careful this year considering the potential threat that surrounds them...</p>
